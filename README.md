# DCPG - Lightweight Change Data Capture for PostgreSQL

DCPG is a custom-built Change Data Capture (CDC) system for PostgreSQL, designed to be resource-efficient and performant. Written in Golang, DCPG leverages PostgreSQL's logical replication to capture changes and process them with minimal latency and resource overhead.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Consumes significantly less CPU and memory compared to other CDC systems.
- **High Performance**: Fast data processing with low latency.
- **Golang-Based**: Aligns with teams that prefer non-Java solutions.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructure and tools, leveraging PostgreSQLâ€™s capabilities.
